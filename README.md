# Steps To Reproduce the App

First, I created a new basic android project

Then, I integrated BLE with these steps : 

## Integrating Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

I followed the official [documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth-le) of Android to do this.

### Adding the right permissions to the app manifest

I add the 3 following lines

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" package="com.moundapp.esp32_ble">
    
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>

</manifest>
```

### Check if the phone supports BLE

Then, I implement a function (quitteSiLapplicationNeSupportePasLeBLE)
that quit the app if the phone doesn't support BLE. I call her in the
onCreate of my MainActivity (This is the first function called when the
application is created)

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        quitteSiLapplicationNeSupportePasLeBLE();
    }

    private void quitteSiLapplicationNeSupportePasLeBLE(){

        //If the phone doesn't support BLE
        if (!getPackageManager().hasSystemFeature(PackageManager.FEATURE_BLUETOOTH_LE)) {
            //Then I show a Toast that indicate the user that it doesn't support bluetooth
            Toast.makeText(this, "Le BLE n'est pas support√© sur cet appareil!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();

            //After, that, I wait 1s to call the finish function that terminate the app
            final Handler handler = new Handler();
            handler.postDelayed(new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    finish();
                }
            }, 1000);
        }

    }
}
```
